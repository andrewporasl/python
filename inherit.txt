1. Shared Code

    - You can put shared code in a parent class.
    - E.g: One shared animal class for dog, cat, etc.

2. Polymorphism
    - You can use the subclasses of a parent class to be treated as objects of said parent class.
    - Meaning you can override methods, make specific methods, or use the parent class methods.
